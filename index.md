<td>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/">Computer Science Department</a> at Boston University. I am advised by Professor <a href="http://people.bu.edu/bkulis/">Brian Kulis</a>. I work as a research assistant in <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/ivc/">the Image and Video Computing (IVC)</a> lab. My academic interests broadly include deep learning, image segmentation, video representation learning, and metric learning for image retrieval.
<br/>
<br/>
Before BU, I was a ME student in <a href="http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/">Computational Science and Engineering</a> at Harvard. During 2013 and 2016, I've been fortunate to work with Dr. Mohammed AlQuraishi and Professor Peter Soger at the Sorger Lab and the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.  Before coming to Harvard, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering at Brown University. During my undergraduate at Beijing Institute of Technology, I studied in Information and Electrical Engineering.
